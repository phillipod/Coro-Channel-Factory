Coro::Channel::Factory version 1.00
===================================

NAME

Coro::Channel::Factory - Factory for named Coro::Channel queues.

SYNOPSIS

   use Coro::Channel::Factory;

   # Initialise factory
   my $factory = Coro::Channel::Factory->new();

   # Get a handle to a (possibly previously undeclared) Coro::Channel, and put 
   # something..
   my $channel = $factory->name('some channel name');
   $channel->put($var);

   # Interacting directly - no intermediate handle object..
   $factory ->name('some channel name')->put($other_var);
   my $item = $factory->('some channel name')->get;

DESCRIPTION

This module provides a very simple name-binding for Coro::Channel, removing the
need to track individual Coro::Channel objects.

As long as the Coro::Channel::Factory object is available, any named 
Coro::Channel can be utilised.
